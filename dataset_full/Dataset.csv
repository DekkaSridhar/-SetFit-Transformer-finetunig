Overpriced unfinished garbage,NEGATIVE
The biggest disadvantage is that the buttons of the body armor cannot be fastened I can only fix it with blue butyl rubber This material does not work either The joints cannot be moved without the heating of a hair dryer After heating it immediately recovers and becomes hard and can no longer move,NEGATIVE
That flaw in the vest is a massive letdown for this figure I have it on BBTS and I feel like canceling Vala should have come up with a fix for it I dont want to have to shave it down Too many production flaws in these figures Not impossible but way too many and its annoying,NEGATIVE
These seem rather subpar for their price Outside of the separating torso and the poor vest clasp design  the figure stands out as incredible quotplasticeyquot next to other lines in your comparison shots Appreciate the review,NEGATIVE
I love the honestly and thoroughness of your reviews Youve helped me make loads of tough collecting decisions including this one Keep rockin,POSITIVE
Most toy lines would just make a vest like that unremovable thats what classified does Frankly even if its a pain its an upgrade from what we get from everyone else,POSITIVE
These look amazing So happy I got a couple to customize Love the realism these guys have with there articulation and accessories,POSITIVE
Quite glad I cancelled my preorders on these The vest tab issue torso splitting and shiny ugly plastic is unacceptable after the very lengthy delays,NEGATIVE
Looking forward to your upcoming reviews of the other Valaverse figures your have Hopefully that splitting at the torso is a QC issue with your Steel igade figure and that the rest of the figures you have dont split while articulating the neck peg,MIXED
Damm I probably have like  plus on pre order for troop building and based on the parts swapping aspect but If the vests are an ongoing issueIm going to have to cancel my orders Its a shamethe figure looks good,NEGATIVE
I got my tracking yesterday ordered  figures and accessories Oooh heck yeah,POSITIVE
Dont like it at all,NEGATIVE
 Great review  Looks like they could make the holes bigger on the vest for the pegs  Kind of annoying to have to do it yourself though  The chest pieces splitting at the neck is a little more concerning though overall,MIXED
theese builds are really nice I love the custom cars in them,POSITIVE
It is very far off  It looks the person is paid to speak well of  igade,NEGATIVE
Brigade only nameall builders are same,NEGATIVE
Still not worth for  crore price ,NEGATIVE
I really want to get into this but tentatively Where I am after exchange and shipping each fig comes to around  Even with Marvel Legends or GI Joe its abut  a shot Collecting has been a slow hobby for me lol,NEGATIVE
Bobby did say Wave  was like starting over at the factory level as the girls were manufactured at a new factory so was like starting from scratch unlike wave  and sds at the other facility so they are more familiar with the items,MIXED
Great review  IMO you have been very balanced with your mix of praise and criticism  A lot of the other people on YouTube have received free figures from Valaverse and refuse to offer any constructive feedback  Its amazing how they sold themselves for a handful of free action figures  My selfrespect is worth more than a couple of hundred bucks  Im not going to order this batch of figures  I do not want any more Action Force figures that have semi frozen joints  I hope that Valaverse follows the same pattern as the original series  If they do the future rerelease should experience a lot less problems,MIXED
this is the one im most excited for Ive loved Steel Brigade since my first one as a kid and Im loving army building them with all the variants  Im definitely going to get a second one at some point,POSITIVE
Too expensive for what you get wait till its ,NEGATIVE
Local coop would result in a serious downgrade in graphics and number of enemies  There is a lot going on and having to render everything twice would make this game unplayable,NEGATIVE

Everything has been sold dont know whos buying ,NEUTRAL

Terrible experience with a realtor who works at this company MARK GIBSON is an unprofessional realtor who is clearly just trying to make easy money by putting in no work The way he handled the showings of my home was completely unacceptable He was allowing people access to the property where they could do an unsupervised self showing He did this without the knowledge or the permission of the tenant or the property owner When he was confronted about the situation he showed zero remorse for violating the tenants privacy and safety,NEGATIVE
